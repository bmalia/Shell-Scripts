# Sprite's Shell Scripts
This is a random collection of shell scripts I've made/am making.
## UpdateChecker
A script to check for both pacman and AUR updates and perform a system upgrade if needed. Currently incomplete and nonfunctional.

## allegationator
A script to convert a list of acts for a person into a file. Largely an experiment on file modification within bash. Mostly complete with a few bugs.

## testarchinstaller
A complete rewrite of `archinstall`, the bundled arch installer script, in shell. Functional, though still missing critical features like installing a bootloader.

## Superfind
The only actual project in here. A command line utility to recursively search filenames for a given search term. Born out of my own problems with my system. Entirely complete, unknown if bugs exist.
